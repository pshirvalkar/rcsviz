This is for using the SCBS to record from two RC+S at the same time (for adaptive recording using one RC+S at the time, for example for montage recordings see the adaptive DBS config files).  

File location: `C:\SCBS` 

Tips: 
* Mode 4 ratio 32 works best 
* Stream 4 TD files at 500Hz
* I always stream power data (focused on specific patient specific bands) 
* Always stream actigraphy
